# Ornithology

Ornithology is a Rust library which exposes a number of combinators, in the form of bird names.
At the moment, this library should be seen as a port of Haskell's
[Data.Aviary.Birds](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/data-aviary-0.4.0/docs/Data-Aviary-Birds.html)
package. I am also taking some inspiration from the JavaScript library
[fantasy-birds](https://github.com/fantasyland/fantasy-birds).

While Data.Aviary.Birds is largely an example package and has no intended us outside of
education, I intended that Ornithology will be a usable library in an actual software, if the
need or desire for combinators arises.
